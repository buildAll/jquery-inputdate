####This is a jquery plugin to allow user to input date directly in the input rather than use the normal datepicker

ToDo List:
.style configuration
.alert validation failed


But you can try below step to have a try of this plugin now:

1.Iinclude below script in your html

    <script src='jquery.js'></script>
    <script src='inputdate.js'></script>

2.Then you can use it in your js code like this

    $(selector).inputdate();
